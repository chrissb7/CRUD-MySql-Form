# CRUD-MySql-Form

The purpose of this project was to build my first ever CRUD front end and back end application. As a challenge, I wanted to delve into PHP and using ajax calls as well. To do this I built for the front end, forms GUI in which the user can input personal data and submit and retrieve a record as well.

Upon submission of one of the forms, the ajax call was made to the back end application. I used MySql as a relational database in which the back end application, depending on what form was submitted, would send the users personal details for storage on the MySql database or retrieve the data. 

The forms allow for Creation and Retrieval of the data. The Update and Delete activities are present in the back end but not the front end, this was tested with hardcoded data and these processes were run within the console. This project was built with XAMPP as it was user friendly with PHP.
